# Warung Example Order Builder App

A mobile-first, performance-optimized static Order Builder built with Vite + React + TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

## Setup

Open a terminal in the project root and run:

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server will run at `http://localhost:5173` by default.

## Notes

- Edit the menu at `src/data/menu.json`.
- Add image files under `public/images` (the menu references `/images/noodles-regular.jpg`).
- This is a static SPA that generates a plain-text order message you can open in WhatsApp or Telegram.
